      <h2>Hamburger</h2>
      <p>
        A hamburger (also burger for short) is a food, typically considered a
        sandwich, consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat,
        usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be
        pan fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served
        with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chiles;
        condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special
        sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are
        frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is
        called a cheeseburger.
