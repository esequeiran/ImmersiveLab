      <h2>Pizza</h2>
      <p>
        Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is an Italian dish
        consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based
        dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients
        (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.),
        which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired
        oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who
        makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

      <h2>Hamburger</h2>
      <p>
        A hamburger (also burger for short) is a food, typically considered a
        sandwich, consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat,
        usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be
        pan fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served
        with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chiles;
        condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special
        sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are
        frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is
        called a cheeseburger.
